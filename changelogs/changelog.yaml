      release_summary: 'Rising From The Ashes


        This is the initial stable release of the Sensu Go Ansible Collection.

        It contains roles for installing and configuring Sensu Go backends and

        agents and a set of modules for managing Sensu Go resources.


        Where does the release name comes from? We took an existing Ansible

        Collection that @flowerysong wrote, gave it a thorough tune-up and

        added a comprehensive test suite. And now, it is ready to face the

        world!

        *api_key* value.

        on Sensu Go 5.21.0 and later. This is a know issue that will be fixed

        documented.

      - Make user module compatible with Sensu Go >= 5.21.0.
      release_summary: 'Break the fall


        There is really only one reason for this release: making sure user

        management works with Sensu Go 5.21.0 and newer. And while the

        upstream did break the API, we did not, so all your playbooks should

        function as nothing happened. We had to add a *bcrypt* dependency to

        our collection so make sure it is installed on hosts that will execute

        the user module.

      minor_changes:
      - Allow modules to supply custom CA bundle for backend certificate validation
        or skip the validation entirely.
      release_summary: 'Self-signed security


        The primary focus of this release is to enable configuration of Sensu

        Go backends that use certificates that are not considered trusted when

        using system-provided CA bundle.
